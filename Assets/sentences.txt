The rat the cat the dog chased killed ate the malt
The horse raced past the barn fell down
The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog
Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow
The five boxing wizards jump quickly 
My grandfather picks up quartz and valuable onyx jewels  
Jack amazed a few girls by dropping the antique onyx vase! 
Grumpy wizards make toxic brew for the evil Queen and Jack  
A quick movement of the enemy will jeopardize six gunboats  
The job requires extra pluck and zeal from every young wage earner  
Be yourself everyone else is already taken
So many books so little time
A room without books is like a body without a soul
You only live once but if you do it right, once is enough 
Be the change that you wish to see in the world 
No one can make you feel inferior without your consent 
If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything 
A friend is someone who knows all about you and still loves you 
Always forgive your enemies nothing annoys them so much 
To live is the rarest thing in the world  Most people exist, that is all 
Without music life would be a mistake 
We accept the love we think we deserve 
Wherever life plants you, bloom with grace
Little by little, day by day, what is mean for you WILL find its way
Learn from yesterday live for today, hope for tomorrow.
I Love you
Now or Never
Get Enough Sleep
Keep it fun
Life won't wait
Never look back
Only Hope Remains
Seize the day
Please help me
Do not lie
Hugs heal all
I have three cats
The birds flew south
She ate french fries
The sun is hot.
She drank orange juice.
I ate it all
It belongs to him
I remembered your number
Leave me alone please
He cannot have breakfast
I will wait for  you
It was an apple pie
We will go with them
They will write to you
We have many good friends
The Corona Virus will kill us
The water is very cold
I think therefore I am
Imagination is greater than detail
Be gentle first with yourself
Live life to the fullest
Make each day your masterpiece
Big egos have little ears
Make yourself necessary to somebody
Turn your wounds into wisdom
Work is love made visible
The greatest wealth is health
Well begun is half done
Failure is success in progress
He who angers you controls you
Master the art of observing
You always have a choice
Live the life you love
Today decisions are tomorrow realities
Calm is a super power
The only easy day was yesterday
The soul cannot live without love
Hope is the dream of a waking man.
An unused life is an early death
Life is a long lesson in humility
Love is the poetry of the senses
Sanity and happiness are an impossible combination
The heart was made to be broken
The very essence of romance is uncertainty
