The rat the cat the dog chased killed ate the malt
The horse raced past the barn fell down
The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog
Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow
The five boxing wizards jump quickly.
My grandfather picks up quartz and valuable onyx jewels. 
Jack amazed a few girls by dropping the antique onyx vase! 
Grumpy wizards make toxic brew for the evil Queen and Jack. 
A quick movement of the enemy will jeopardize six gunboats. 
The job requires extra pluck and zeal from every young wage earner. 
Be yourself everyone else is already taken.
So many books so little time.
A room without books is like a body without a soul.
You only live once but if you do it right, once is enough.
Be the change that you wish to see in the world.
No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.
If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything.
A friend is someone who knows all about you and still loves you.
Always forgive your enemies nothing annoys them so much.
To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all.
Without music life would be a mistake.
We accept the love we think we deserve.
Wherever life plants you, bloom with grace
Little by little, day by day, what is mean for you WILL find its way
Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow
